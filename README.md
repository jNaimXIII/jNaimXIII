# Heyo! How's it going?

> Everything that you thought had meaning; every hope, dream or moment of
> happinessâ€¦ none of it matters, as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield.
> None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body. We all die.

> But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was
> no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What
> about their lives? Were they meaningless?

> They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all. The courageous
> fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we, the
> living, refuse to forget them. And as we ride to certain death, we trust our
> successors to do the same for us. Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield
> when faced with the cruelty of this world.
